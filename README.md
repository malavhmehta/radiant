- Spheres, rectangles
- Diffuse, metal and dielectric surfaces
- Motion blur
- Solid, perlin noise and image textures
- Light sources
- Constant density volumes (smoke, fog)
- Bounding volume hierarchies
- Multi-threading: worker-dispatcher model

## Samples

Here are two samples testing nearly all the ray tracer's features.
